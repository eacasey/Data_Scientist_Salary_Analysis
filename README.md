# Data Scientist Salary Analysis

- For this project, I seek to explore some data that I found on Kaggle, which contains information about various data scientist positions. Relevant variables include 
years of experience required, location, salary ranges (coded), and job descriptions. 

- I begin by conducting an exploratory data analysis and also doing some data manipulation and data cleaning.

- I then move on to modeling and exploring various classification algorithms. As of the time of this writing, I am currently still in the modeling phase and am still
working to improve the model accuracy while also decreasing the number of features. I will update this as I make progress.
